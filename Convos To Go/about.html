    <h1>Our Company</h1>
  </div>
  <p>ConvosToGo is an online service that connects people of all kinds to
specialized experts in a variety of fields. Our goal is to share and spread
knowledge and connection in a way that feels fresh, but is also the
simplest of them all: human interaction.</p>

<div class="container">

  <h1>Our Service</h1>
</div>
  <p>To interact and develop connections, we offer three types of
subscriptions: Instant Message, Video Chat, and Face-to-Face
conversation. Once a client has selected their preference and
expressed their interests, they are free to browse our extensive roster
of experts who can then be contacted to schedule meetings.</p>

  <h1>Our Start</h1>
</div>
  <p>ConvosToGo began with three college students who wondered if
humanity’s innate need for sharing knowledge, interest, & experience
could become something more. Starting on campus at Rutgers
University – Camden, they pooled the resources around them for the
first ever group of experts and the project has only grown from there.</p>
